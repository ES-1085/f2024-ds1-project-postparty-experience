The Postpartum Experience
================
by Emmy Wahlström, Tikyra Downs, and Willow Gibson

## Summary

Overview of the data and what we hoped to explore / what we did explore.

In this project we were focused on identifying the quality of care that survey respondents had access to. Were also curious about how what care was accessible vs what care were cited as most critical. We initially thought about assigning numerical values to the quality categories and looking at them through a lens of "good/better/best" types of care. Each category would have been additive moving through the scale. We planned to look at that data on on a leaflet map in order to display quality of care across the US.

BASELINE SUPPORT: Care needed to prevent the worst long term health outcomes (i.e. organ prolapse, long term depression, etc.)
Lactation support, pelvic floor PT, emotional support, hospital/office follow up appointments, unpaid parental leave

PHYSICAL SUPPORT: Care that increases the birthing parent and baby’s physical wellbeing beyond baseline support
In-home help with care tasks, in-home follow up appointments, bodywork like massage or chiropractic, acupuncture, or overnight help

COMMUNITY SUPPORT: Care that builds and maintains community around the birthing parent/family for long term support
Help with meals (meal train or meal service), new parent groups (online and in-person), family & friend support, paid parental leave

CARE TASKS: As defined by the author KC Davis, LPC: 
                     “Care tasks describes any task, chore, or errand that is required to care for self and keep life going. Typically, these tasks are recurring, never-ending, and are required to be completed in order to "get on with living."
In the context of the postpartum experience, this might include childcare of other children, help with cleaning, cooking, or laundry, holding the baby while the parent sleeps or bathes, picking up groceries, or other helpful tasks around the home.

EMOTIONAL SUPPORT: Formal and informal mental health treatment - therapy, PPD/PPA medications, advice from loved ones or doulas, etc.

For this project, our research question concerns the state of postpartum care in the US. We want to look more deeply at several of the relationships between variables in this dataset to evaluate some key aspects of the postpartum experience. Some of the questions we hope to explore are:

1. If we categorize postpartum care into "good", "better", and "best" categories, what quality of postpartum care is the average birther receiving?

2. Does quality of postpartum care vary from state to state?

3. Is there a correlation between age and quality of postpartum care received/offered?

4. What states require postpartum care to be covered by insurance? Does that requirement for coverage extend to Medicare recipients only, or does it extend to private insurance companies?

5. What types of postpartum support did respondents say were most critical to their household within the first year following birth? Are these types of care typically covered by insurance or are families paying for these services out of pocket?

6. Critical care vs ideal care - what are the differences?


## Methods

The Postpartum Experience Survey was created by Willow Gibson for a research project assigned in a course titled "History of Midwifery and Women's Healthcare in the US" at College of the Atlantic in 2022. The data was collected through a Google form survey that was circulated via email and briefly on social media. The survey accepted responses for 1 week in February 2022 and received 788 responses. The purpose of collecting this information was to observe the state of postpartum care in the US across the ten year period of 2013 - 2023 with the goal of learning what gaps in care exist. The dataset is unpublished and is considered preliminary data only. The survey questions can be viewed [here] (add link).

## Analysis

In the process of cleaning our data we came to understand how important survey design is. It is a balancing act to elicit authentic responses from survey respondents while simultaneously ensuring the data collected is tidy enough to use for creating plots. We found that this survey may have offered too many opportunities for open ended responses. It was necessary to standardize answers in order to create meaningful and readable plots. We found that a bar chart was effective for displaying the percent of respondents that had access to different types of care, while a ridge plot 

What plots we used and what we learned from them

## Conclusions

Many people noted that their partner's help was most critical to them. While we recognize how vital a supportive partnership is in the journey of parenting, particularly in the early postpartum period, this survey was focused on postpartum support beyond the parents of the child.

There were also a number of responses that mentioned what "would" have been most critical to them. We excluded these answers from our analysis of critical care, but think it's important to mention that there are families who endure the postpartum experience with zero outside support.

## Notes from Laurie about summary
Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your handout. The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read
out loud. Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750
words. 

Your results with proper output and
graphics go in your handout, this space is for a brief summary of
your project.
