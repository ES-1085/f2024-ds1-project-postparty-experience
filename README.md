The Postpartum Experience
================
by Emmy Wahlström, Tikyra Downs, and Willow Gibson

## Summary

Overview of the data and what we hoped to explore / what we did explore.


## Analysis

What plots we used and what we learned from them

## Methods

Notes here about the way the data was collected and that it can only be considered "preliminary data".

## Conclusions

Many people noted that their partner's help was most critical to them. While we recognize how vital a supportive partnership is in the journey of parenting, particularly in the early postpartum period, this survey was focused on postpartum support beyond the parents of the child.

There were also a number of responses that mentioned what "would" have been most critical to them. We excluded these answers from our analysis of critical care, but think it's important to mention that there are families who endure the postpartum experience with zero outside support.

## Notes from Laurie about summary
Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your handout. The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read
out loud. Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750
words. 

Your results with proper output and
graphics go in your handout, this space is for a brief summary of
your project.

## Handout

Our presentation can be found [here](handout/handout.pdf). You can update the filename and extension of your handout.

## Memo

A link to the code and how we created our graphics in our memo can be found [here](memo/memo.html).
