In home lactation support, provided by insurance. It was excruciatingly painful to make trips back and forth to the hospital (30mins each way) for lactation and weight checks starting 3 days PP. With both babies we had weight gain issues and for the first month we would have to go 1-3x a week. (Kaiser Permanente insurance needs to make serious improvements in this area) 
2. Emotional well mama therapies/counseling with a postpartum therapist would have been extremely beneficial. My mental headspace was better with the 1-2 child change but maternal mental health is in my opinion in a very fragile state. Even with having community and family we need to provide dedicated support in this area. 
3. Legitimate meal train/home support. It’s a lot to put on ONE partner to have most of the cooking, cleaning, childcare (of older children), and attending to postpartum mom alone. Even when you have family close it’s hard.","I think the postpartum period  is one of the most challenging, beautiful,  and isolating experiences of one’s life. Personally I wish we placed as much care - if not more upon postpartum as we do during pregnancy. I spent lots of time prepping myself for postpartum mentally and emotionally for my second child. With my first it was a train wreck. The next time around, I honored a 4 week rest period in bed (aside from an asinine number of lactation/feeding appointments). I can honestly say that the healing, recovery, and pelvic floor was a night and day difference from the first pregnancy.

How can you be expected to go back to work when your baby is still breastfeeding every 2-3 hours and can't even hold their up properly yet!! All other developed nations give mothers the option to take 1 year off, at least your infant is a bit more independent by then and may or may not be breastfeeding anymore. 

Maternity leave in America is inhumane, it's anti-family, it's unjust. Pleaaaaase help us change that!!!

My blood pressure was extremely high for two weeks postpartum and because it wasn’t accompanied by headache the doctors kept dismissing it. 

I needed major lactation support. I only kept at it because of the sheer intensity of hormones and my own stubbornness but also felt stuck with few options for help and was charged a huge bill for unhelpful lactation consulting. Eventually I found an IBCLC after a lot of searching in Facebook groups asking other people for help, and at 7.5 months got my baby nursing after exclusively pumping all that time. This was incredibly stressful and took literally months of my life (600 hours of pumping in 7 months). 

I would have absolutely loved any help at home. My baby was born in 2020 and so all dreams of hiring someone to help me went out the window. No one came into my house because of pandemic quarantine protocols. It was in some ways very special to have that time just me and baby, but also so, so difficult. I’m envious when I hear of the kinds of support that others get from friends and family. My friends did make a meal train for me and that was helpful for those first few weeks.","It was shocking how little follow up there was from my OB about my own health. I felt like baby got excellent attention and I got none despite having had a very complicated pregnancy and c section.","Wagnerce@gmail.com"

Also, meals and childcare support from friends/family.","I wish we had some postpartum doula support, especially to help navigate home chores and provide information on early baby development. I loved my in person support group, and which insurance had covered that. Additionally, all of the nursing/pumping supplies was super expensive. My pump and basic parts were covered by insurance, but I had to buy multiple flange sizes and other equipment that really added up. I also wish that bodywork had been covered by insurance. I would have really benefited from massage therapy and chiropractic care following birth. And home visiting for after birth visits!",NA,"Lizzy.s.appleby@gmail.com"

I also learned during this time that most therapy isn't covered by insurance. This is insane, as most new mothers desperately need mental health support, and it is often cost prohibitive. I had PTSD symptoms for a year afterwards and required treatment, which was $400 a week for months.

I also had a very rough return to work with a very short maternity leave and a lot of bullying and harassment upon my return. I think we need to make 6 months paid leave a normal thing.

5. Tongue tie services for the baby","I paid out of pocket about 6,500  to go to Midwifery practice. The hospital also billed me but I couldn’t afford to pay the hospital as well.  My first birth I owed the doctors office after insurance 2,800 and after insurance the hospital billed me 2,500. My first birth lactation services were not covered and I paid $450 for a visit. Second birth lactation services were covered up to 6 visits but there was a co pay. Pelvic floor therapy has not been covered at all. My postpartum for my second was hardest due to PPD/PPA.

We do not provide any postpartum care that is adequate enough to fully support a mom during the hardest parts of being a mom. We also do not support our babies once they are born. We don’t provide preschool or paid time off or good child care. So many people claim to be pro life, but they really don’t support the life of the mom or baby after that birth.","Sinclaircm@gmail.com"
