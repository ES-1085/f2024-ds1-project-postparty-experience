This document should contain a detailed account of the data clean up for your data and the design choices you are making for your plots. For instance you will want to document choices you've made that were intentional for your graphic, e.g. color you've chosen for the plot. Think of this document as a code script someone can follow to reproduce the data cleaning steps and graphics in your handout.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}

library(stringr)

```{r read-in-data}

Postpartum <- read.csv("Postpartum.csv")
```


## Data Clean Up Steps for Overall Data

### Step 1: Cleaning `age`

```{r first-birth-age}
Postpartum <- Postpartum |> 
  mutate(first_age = substr(age, start = 1, stop = 2)) |> 
  mutate(first_age = if_else(first_age == "On", "35", first_age)) |> 
  mutate(first_age = as.numeric(first_age)) |> 
arrange(first_age) |> 

relocate(first_age, .after = age)

```

### Step 2: Cleaning `state`

```{r state-clean-up-names}
Postpartum <- Postpartum |>
  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "CO", "Colorado")) |>
  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "IA", "Iowa")) |>

  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "NY", "New York")) |>
  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "Tennesee", "Tennessee")) |>

  #In order to correct specific mistakes/misspellings etc across the data frame.
#using stringr package  

  filter(state != "United States",
         state != "United states",
         state != "US",
         state != "USA")
```

```{r state-clean-up-first-entry}

  mutate(first_state = str_replace(first_state, "pennsylvania", "Pennsylvania")) 
  
 unique(Postpartum$first_state)

```


### Step 3: Cleaning `support_type`

```{r rename-answer-with-commas}
Postpartum <- Postpartum |>
  mutate(support_type = str_replace(support_type, pattern = "In-home help with tasks like laundry, cooking, cleaning, and child care", "In-home help with care tasks"))

```

```{r recheck-unqiue-entries}
unique(Postpartum$support_type)
```


### Step 4: Cleaning `birth_location`

```{r birth-location-cleanup}

Postpartum <- Postpartum |>
  mutate(birth_location = ifelse(birth_location == "Hospital, Was supposed to go to birth center", "Hospital", birth_location)) |>  
  mutate(birth_location = ifelse(birth_location == "At home", "Non-Hospital", birth_location)) |>

  mutate(birth_location = ifelse(birth_location ==  "Hospital, Car", "NA", birth_location))
  
```

### Step 5: Cleaning `critical`

```{r rename-critical-clean}

Postpartum <- rename(Postpartum, "critical" = "critial_clean")

```

```{r relocate-new-critical-variable}
Postpartum <- relocate(Postpartum, critical, .after = critical_support)

```

```{r critical-separate-longer}

Postpartum <- Postpartum |>
   separate_longer_delim(critical, delim = ",")
   
```

### Move to extra file??
```{r baseline}

#baseline <- c("Lactation support", "Pelvic floor rehabilitation",  "Emotional support",  "Hospital or office based wellness services and postpartum follow up appointments")

#better <- c("")

#best <- c("")

#baseline_pattern <- "lact|pelv|"

#Postpartum_support_type_clean <- Postpartum_support_type_clean |>
  #mutate(baseline = case_when(str_detect(support_type, pattern = regex(baseline_pattern, ignore_case = T)) ~ 1,
                         #    TRUE ~ 0)) 

#Postpartum_support_type_clean <- Postpartum_support_type_clean |>
  #mutate(baseline = case_when(support_type %in% baseline ~ 1,
                          #    TRUE ~ 0)) |>
  #mutate(service_category = case_when(support_type %in% baseline ~ "baseline",
                            #  TRUE ~ 0)) |>
  
 # relocate(baseline, .after = support_type)

#  Postpartum_support_type_clean |>
 # group_by(respondent, birth_age) |>
#  mutate(support_type_all = str_flatten(support_type, collapse = ", ")) |>
#  summarize(baseline_score = sum(baseline, na.rm = TRUE))
#  distinct(respondent, birth_age, .keep_all = TRUE) # we don't need this line, example only

#Postpartum_support_type_clean |>
# group_by(respondent, birth_age) |>
#  summarize(baseline_score = sum(baseline, na.rm = TRUE))|>
#  ungroup() |>
#  distinct(baseline_score)

```
