Project memo
================
Postparty Experience - Tikyra, Emmy, and Willow

This document should contain a detailed account of the data clean up for
your data and the design choices you are making for your plots. For
instance you will want to document choices you’ve made that were
intentional for your graphic, e.g. color you’ve chosen for the plot.
Think of this document as a code script someone can follow to reproduce
the data cleaning steps and graphics in your handout.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(gridExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(openintro)
library(countrycode)

```

``` r
Postpartum <- read.csv("Postpartum.csv")
```

## Data Clean Up Steps for Overall Data

### Step 1: Rename variables

``` r
# This step occurred in the proposal, but we wanted to ensure all clean up steps were included in the memo.

# Postpartum_Experience_renamed_variables <- as_tibble(Postpartum_Experience_Survey_Responses_raw_data) %>% 
 # rename( 
    #  `respondent` = `Timestamp`,
     # `state` = `Which US state or country did you give birth in?`,
     # `age` = `What was your age when you gave birth?`, 
     # `birth_location` = `Where did you give birth?`,
    #  `informed_by` = `When you were pregnant, did your care provider give you information about postpartum care services?`,
    #  `other_info_sources` = `Did you learn about postpartum care services from any other sources?`, 
    #  `support_type`= `What types of support did you have access to postpartum?`,
    #  `provider` = `Who provided this support for you?`,
    #  `ins_covered_services` = `What postpartum care services did your insurance cover?`,
    #  `cost_factor` = `Was cost a factor in how much support you received?`,
    # `if_insurance` = `If insurance covered postpartum care services, would you take advantage of it?`,
    # `critical_support` = `What support was most critical to you/your household in first year following birth?`,
    # `ideal_support` = `In a best case scenario, list all types of care and support you would need or want in the first year postpartum.`,
    # `comments` = `Is there anything else you want to share about your postpartum experience?`,
    # `emails` = `If you are open to follow up questions or want the results from this research project, please enter your email below.`)
```

### Step 2: Manual translation of ’critical_care\`

Each entry in `critical_care` was manually translated to match the
terminology used in the multiple choice answers listed in the
`support_type` variable. This resulted in a new “clean” version of
`critical_care` variable called `critical`. The purpose of this cleaning
step was to make the open ended answers easier to graph and compare to
other variables. Consistent language allows for clearer and more
meaningful visualizations.

``` r
# This step occurred in the proposal, but we wanted to ensure all clean up steps were included in the memo.

# Postpartum_combined <- bind_cols(Postpartum_Experience_renamed_variables, Clean_critical_care)

# head(Postpartum_combined)
```

### Step 3: Clean `age`

``` r
Postpartum <- Postpartum |> 
  mutate(first_age = substr(age, start = 1, stop = 2)) |> 
  mutate(first_age = if_else(first_age == "On", "35", first_age)) |> 
  mutate(first_age = as.numeric(first_age)) |> 
arrange(first_age) |> 

relocate(first_age, .after = age)
```

### Step 4: Clean `state`

``` r
Postpartum <- Postpartum |>
  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "CO", "Colorado")) |>
  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "IA", "Iowa")) |>
  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "DC", "Washington, D.C.")) |>

  mutate(state = str_replace(state, "Tennesee", "Tennessee")) |>

  #In order to correct specific mistakes/misspellings etc across the data frame.
#using stringr package  

  filter(state != "United States",
         state != "United states",
         state != "US",
         state != "USA")
```

    ##  [53] "Child care because we don't have family nearby and because maternity leave in the US is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. I don't know why all the women/moms in this country don't revolt against it. How can you be expected to go back to work when your baby is still breastfeeding every 2-3 hours and can't even hold their up properly yet!! All other developed nations give mothers the option to take 1 year off, at least your infant is a bit more independent by then and may or may not be breastfeeding anymore. \n\nMaternity leave in America is inhumane, it's anti-family, it's unjust. Pleaaaaase help us change that!!! Please!!!"
