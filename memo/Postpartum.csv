My friends and family were absolutely amazing after both births. However medically speaking, my care in TN was more aligned to what I needed. My obgyn, lactation specialist, and even child’s pediatrician regularly checked in with my king after my 6 week check up. They offered resources including specialized therapists and support groups when PPD sank in about 10 weeks after my first birth. This was all while I was on Medicaid. 

With my second birth, it was an entirely different experience. I was also on Medicaid, but had very limited resources. My OB only saw me three times the entire pregnancy - the initial visit, 6 months, and then at birth. I was bounced around to various different nurse practitioners in between. Post-birth - I relied heavily on my knowledge from the first pregnancy, my own research, family and friends, as #2 was entirely different than the first. I slipped into PPD quite quickly and when I expressed my concerns and gave my history of PPD with my first, my doctor simply gave me a Zoloft prescription and said see you at the 6week check up. He also tried to push birth control for hormonal support heavily (even though he knew of my clotting disorder. I simply cannot do BC). I ended up paying for therapy out of pocket and tried to find support groups, although this was very difficult and I ended up relying on online support groups. I never filled the prescription. 

I tried to ween breastfeeding around 8 weeks, bc I felt like it was the best thing for me mentally and physically. My gyno and my pediatrician were both very disrespectful about this decision and guilted me into continuing. I forced myself to do this for a few more weeks, but eventually weened, because I was mentally at a breaking point. 

I often say, if I were to ever have another child, i would move back to TN just for the pregnancy/postpartum support. All I wanted was to be heard, and I felt like I was often talking to a void during my care in MS.","Cscavine@gmail.com"

This also affects our babies' well being. Our medical care system is so ""baby-first"" that it ignores the reality that a baby's wellbeing is tied closely to it's mother's wellbeing in that first year. 

I also learned during this time that most therapy isn't covered by insurance. This is insane, as most new mothers desperately need mental health support, and it is often cost prohibitive. I had PTSD symptoms for a year afterwards and required treatment, which was $400 a week for months.

I also had a very rough return to work with a very short maternity leave and a lot of bullying and harassment upon my return. I think we need to make 6 months paid leave a normal thing.

This also affects our babies' well being. Our medical care system is so ""baby-first"" that it ignores the reality that a baby's wellbeing is tied closely to it's mother's wellbeing in that first year. 

I also learned during this time that most therapy isn't covered by insurance. This is insane, as most new mothers desperately need mental health support, and it is often cost prohibitive. I had PTSD symptoms for a year afterwards and required treatment, which was $400 a week for months.

I also had a very rough return to work with a very short maternity leave and a lot of bullying and harassment upon my return. I think we need to make 6 months paid leave a normal thing. This may seem like a long time, but at 6 months a child can sit up by themselves and are beginning to eat solid foods.

This was crucial, as seeking out a therapist and getting an appointment would have been an insurmountable hurdle for me. 
I think there needs to be more support for partners as well, because my husband really didn't know how to help me or adjust to his new role in a way that was sustainable. That ultimately lead to more stress for me, as he burned out and also had to go back to work","Barnettav@gmail.com"

I also think education on pushing would be helpful for first time mothers—just in case. With my first I couldn’t feel due to my epidural and pushed for 2.5 hours which added to the trauma down there. With my second my epidural was less strong and I could somewhat feel, but it wasn’t until an hour in the nurse told me I was pushing well but needed to hold my pelvic floor open between breaths and pushes. As soon as she said that I was able to push my child out right after. The trauma on my pelvic floor has been substantial despite doing pregnancy specific workouts while pregnant but this information could be critical to reducing the issues I now have.","liesakuhns@gmail.com"
