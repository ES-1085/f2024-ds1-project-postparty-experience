Finding someone to help and calling them when you are sleep deprived and have a newborn feels impossible. Being given names of lactation support people, and tongue tie specialists for my baby was critical for me. That came from my doula. My OBs did not have any specific recommendations for me, even for pelvic floor PT later on.","My second child was a million times easier even with similar breastfeeding challenges because I was prepared with resources beforehand. But both times there is a sense that you are just completely on your own after you get home after having a million nurses checking everything in the hospital. I had home visits from my doula after the first birth which were critical. My second was a pandemic baby and I had very little support but the hospital had a single in home nurse visit which was somewhat beneficial.

Physical recovery from birth was difficult and I was shocked how little follow up care there was. I’ve had more follow up care for smaller medical things unrelated to birth in the past than I did postpartum. The resources and supports that could have helped us were simply not there or would have been out of pocket costs that we could not afford. I do not have family in the area and our friends could also not help much. In my opinion postpartum care in the US needs a major overhaul.","ulrikeanita@gmail.com"

However, I am shocked at how much we ask new mothers - literal days after birth - to leave their home. Because my baby was jaundiced, I visited our pediatrician’s office four times in his first week of life. That was an incredibly stressful experience and I truly believe that shifting to home based care would be ideal. Secondly, I was also very lucky to get prenatal and postpartum pelvic floor physical therapy coverage. That should be standard for all women. Finally, the single six week checkup is inadequate and no longer supported by ACOG but I do not know of any of my friends or family who have not had a doctor who defaults to the six week checkup. It’s disheartening to see the changes supported by evidence take so long to implement in practice. Oh and paid family leave - like why are we still talking about it?

I wasn’t allowed to leave the birth center at the hospital until we had insurance for our daughter, which was totally not on my radar and never mentioned in any of my education or prep support before birth. And it was hard to find out what was covered and what costs would be if paid out of pocket. And when my postpartum anxiety was bad, my therapists recommended me to the midwives who then just recommended I see a therapist. So, friends became extra helpful then. This all broke apart 6 months in because covid hit so the small semblance of a community of postpartum support we had pieced together all fell apart. And as I prepare for a second  child, I don’t have paid leave (I shifted from full time W2 work with health insurance from to a 1099 consulting practice with high insurance costs we pay out to of pocket). I’d love what Germany and other countries have! And, we have privilege and access and so many people don’t, I don’t know how marriages survive without such community care and I know many babies and children suffer as a result. Also, it turned out that birthing a baby also triggered a mental breakdown in our local in-laws, who we thought would be part of of our child care and support.

It would be great if part of your postpartum care included some therapy sessions since motherhood changes and shifts everything in your life. I have a supportive spouse but wow the difference it made when he had paternity leave. With our first he didn’t and could only take a week off with our second he had leave and had 5 weeks off. That made a difference in my mental health because I had help for longer in the beginning with sleep and daily tasks because he could be there to help.","Some of the night and day difference of the first year with each kid was due to my pediatrician.

My friends and family were absolutely amazing after both births. However medically speaking, my care in TN was more aligned to what I needed. My obgyn, lactation specialist, and even child’s pediatrician regularly checked in with my king after my 6 week check up. They offered resources including specialized therapists and support groups when PPD sank in about 10 weeks after my first birth. This was all while I was on Medicaid. 

With my second birth, it was an entirely different experience. I was also on Medicaid, but had very limited resources. My OB only saw me three times the entire pregnancy - the initial visit, 6 months, and then at birth. I was bounced around to various different nurse practitioners in between. Post-birth - I relied heavily on my knowledge from the first pregnancy, my own research, family and friends, as #2 was entirely different than the first. I slipped into PPD quite quickly and when I expressed my concerns and gave my history of PPD with my first, my doctor simply gave me a Zoloft prescription and said see you at the 6week check up. He also tried to push birth control for hormonal support heavily (even though he knew of my clotting disorder. I simply cannot do BC). I ended up paying for therapy out of pocket and tried to find support groups, although this was very difficult and I ended up relying on online support groups. I never filled the prescription. 

I tried to ween breastfeeding around 8 weeks, bc I felt like it was the best thing for me mentally and physically. My gyno and my pediatrician were both very disrespectful about this decision and guilted me into continuing. I forced myself to do this for a few more weeks, but eventually weened, because I was mentally at a breaking point. 

I often say, if I were to ever have another child, i would move back to TN just for the pregnancy/postpartum support. All I wanted was to be heard, and I felt like I was often talking to a void during my care in MS.","Cscavine@gmail.com"

For example, nursing is accepted by society as “natural” and therefore not recognized for how taxing it is physically, emotionally, and time-wise. Therefore partners may not know to take additional responsibilities off a nursing parent (ex: diapering, laundry, making doctors’ appointments) because overall it’s not seen as work, This contributes to birthing parents being overwhelmed, burned out, or distressed. 

Additionally, education on how to bond with the baby to ease the responsibilities on the birthing parent is needed. The partners who don’t form this bond “can’t hear” a baby’s cries in the newborn phase and puts an undue burden on a nursing parent. Once a baby develops a preference for the birthing parent, it makes it very hard for that parent to step away and get a break. Partners can fall back on “The baby prefers you” which contributes to an imbalance in work/responsibility.","sylvie.writing@gmail.com"

My blood pressure was extremely high for two weeks postpartum and because it wasn’t accompanied by headache the doctors kept dismissing it. 

I needed major lactation support. I only kept at it because of the sheer intensity of hormones and my own stubbornness but also felt stuck with few options for help and was charged a huge bill for unhelpful lactation consulting. Eventually I found an IBCLC after a lot of searching in Facebook groups asking other people for help, and at 7.5 months got my baby nursing after exclusively pumping all that time. This was incredibly stressful and took literally months of my life (600 hours of pumping in 7 months). 

I would have absolutely loved any help at home. My baby was born in 2020 and so all dreams of hiring someone to help me went out the window. No one came into my house because of pandemic quarantine protocols. It was in some ways very special to have that time just me and baby, but also so, so difficult. I’m envious when I hear of the kinds of support that others get from friends and family. My friends did make a meal train for me and that was helpful for those first few weeks.","It was shocking how little follow up there was from my OB about my own health.

I’m lucky to have money to pay for help and the support of a partner and parents. And when my son was born 3 years later, I was volunteering for a postpartum warmline because I didn’t want women to feel alone and scared like I had. I had resources and connections. I set up everything before my birth- an afterbirth plan.

2. Emotional well mama therapies/counseling with a postpartum therapist would have been extremely beneficial. My mental headspace was better with the 1-2 child change but maternal mental health is in my opinion in a very fragile state.

With my first it was a train wreck. The next time around, I honored a 4 week rest period in bed (aside from an asinine number of lactation/feeding appointments).

Weekly recovery check ins from a doula or midwife. Nobody checked on my recovery at all during this time.
2. Lactation or formula consultation (nursing isn't possible for everyone and there is no info given about nursing alternatives)
3. Therapy for post partum depression/other complications covered by insurance
4. Pelvic floor PT. I had this and it was awesome and very necessary
5. New parents (mother's) groups through hospital and friends
6. 6 months paid maternity leave from work and discrimination protection/ramp up support upon return.
7. Discounted or tax deductible childcare. This is a no brainer. We don't even have guaranteed leave and childcare in my area runs about $25-50k a year per child depending on what you choose. Unless you have a lucrative job, it forces you to rethink whether you want to work at all.","I read somewhere that in America we view mother's as the wrappers on a Reese's peanut butter cup. Once the baby is born the wrapper no longer matters. This is very true. Mothers' wellbeing matters because we are people and we deserve the dignity of support for our own well being during recovery. This also affects our babies' well being. Our medical care system is so ""baby-first"" that it ignores the reality that a baby's wellbeing is tied closely to it's mother's wellbeing in that first year. 

I also learned during this time that most therapy isn't covered by insurance. This is insane, as most new mothers desperately need mental health support, and it is often cost prohibitive. I had PTSD symptoms for a year afterwards and required treatment, which was $400 a week for months.

I also had a very rough return to work with a very short maternity leave and a lot of bullying and harassment upon my return. I think we need to make 6 months paid leave a normal thing. This may seem like a long time, but at 6 months a child can sit up by themselves and are beginning to eat solid foods. These things make it easier to leave baby in the care of someone else.","nkallianpurkar@gmail.com"

I was pumped every two hours during the day and every 3 hours over night for eight months, desperate to do anything right. I was a complete wreck. It wasn't until I started developing suicidal ideation when he was 5 months old that I realized I wasn't ok and started trying to get help- help that I wasn't able to actually access due to insurance red tape until he was 8 months old. In 2016, I was hospitalized with preeclampsia on complete bedrest at 34 weeks and was induced at 36 weeks with my daughter, who had no health complications. I went back to work at 9 weeks even though I wasn't physically, emotionally, or mentally ready - what option did I have? I had PTSD from the NICU experience even though my daughter was healthy. My PPD manifested with apathy, intrusive thoughts, and suicidal ideation. I was able to access support (medication and counseling) but again it was delayed due to red tape and being able to find a provider.

This was not NEARLY enough support.","EASILY accessible lactation support, planned in advance (it was a struggle to find insurance covered lactation support, and even worse to do it after babies were born), postpartum doula, in home emotional support, immediate household help for meals, cleaning, bottle prep, overnight relief to be able to sleep or rest, assistance to be able to leave the house, pelvic floor therapy and physical movement therapy (I could not even walk after my twins were born, because my core was so destroyed, and even the hospital didn’t know how to help).","Postpartum after twins was extremely traumatic.  I was in no way prepared, even having been connected in advance to the twins group.  I had extreme postpartum anxiety and had no time to sleep or rest, and the impact on my body was traumatic and the medical establishment did NOT care once the baby is out and alive!  

I have never felt more acutely that survival was just a matter of luck and chance and that we were just barely alive - that evolution only allowed for bare survival and not thriving, and that if one thing went wrong it would be all our demise.  

I had to create almost all support resources myself and was really not in a potion to do so and had to learn all of it in crisis. 

For my second pregnancy (3rd child) I knew better to prepare myself in advance with setting up lactation support, (but still struggled with emergencies), feeding supplies, core support equipment, , we already had a nanny at home, had my mom arrive in advance, etc.  But I still could not easily access emotional support (my last postpartum therapist was now out of network, and setting up new care is exceedingly difficult), and couldn’t afford postpartum doula support which would have been so helpful since I had to quarantine with my baby since the toddlers had pneumonia.

Meanwhile, I was materially penalized at work in both pregnancies, which just makes the societal lack of postpartum support even more punishing.   And was described as having spent time at home “enjoying my baby”.","susananton2013@gmail.com"
